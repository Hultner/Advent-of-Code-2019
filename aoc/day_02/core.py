--- Day 2: 1202 Program Alarm ---

On the way to your gravity assist around the Moon, your ship computer beeps
angrily about a "1202 program alarm". On the radio, an Elf is already
explaining how to handle the situation: "Don't worry, that's perfectly norma--"
The ship computer bursts into flames.

You notify the Elves that the computer's magic smoke seems to have escaped.
"That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was
working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode
computer!"

def part_1(puzzle_input: Tuple[Number] = p1) -> Number:
    """
    An Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas (like
    1,0,0,3,99).  To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called
    position 0). Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99. The opcode
    indicates what to do; for example, 99 means that the program is finished
    and should immediately halt.  Encountering an unknown opcode means
    something went wrong.

    Opcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the
    result in a third position. The three integers immediately after the opcode
    tell you these three positions - the first two indicate the positions from
    which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the
    position at which the output should be stored.

    For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read
    the values at positions 10 and 20, add those values, and then overwrite the
    value at position 30 with their sum.

    Opcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs
    instead of adding them. Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate
    where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.

    Once you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping
    forward 4 positions.

    For example, suppose you have the following program:

    1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50 For the purposes of illustration, here is the
    same program split into multiple lines:

    1,9,10,3,
    2,3,11,0,
    99,
    30,40,50

    The first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    Together, they represent the first opcode (1, addition), the positions of
    the two inputs (9 and 10), and the position of the output (3). To handle
    this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions:
    position 9 contains 30, and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers
    together to get 70. Then, store this value at the output position; here,
    the output position (3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself.
    Afterward, the program looks like this:

    1,9,10,70,
    2,3,11,0,
    99,
    30,40,50

    Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2. This opcode works
    just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding. The inputs are
    at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively.
    Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:

    3500,9,10,70,
    2,3,11,0,
    99,
    30,40,50

    Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives
    at opcode 99, halting the program.

    Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

     - 1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99 (1 + 1 = 2).
     - 2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99 (3 * 2 = 6).
     - 2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801 (99 * 99 = 9801).
     - 1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.

    Once you have a working computer, the first step is to restore the gravity
    assist program (your puzzle input) to the "1202 program alarm" state it had
    just before the last computer caught fire. To do this, before running the
    program, replace position 1 with the value 12 and replace position 2 with
    the value 2. What value is left at position 0 after the program halts?

    program = list(p1)

    c.run_program()
    return c.read(0)

    --- Part Two ---

    "Good, the new computer seems to be working correctly! Keep it nearby
    during this mission - you'll probably use it again. Real Intcode computers
    support many more features than your new one, but we'll let you know what
    they are as you need them."

    "However, your current priority should be to complete your gravity assist
    around the Moon. For this mission to succeed, we should settle on some
    terminology for the parts you've already built."

    Intcode programs are given as a list of integers; these values are used as
    the initial state for the computer's memory. When you run an Intcode
    program, make sure to start by initializing memory to the program's values.
    A position in memory is called an address (for example, the first value in
    memory is at "address 0").

    Opcodes (like 1, 2, or 99) mark the beginning of an instruction. The values
    used immediately after an opcode, if any, are called the instruction's
    parameters. For example, in the instruction 1,2,3,4, 1 is the opcode; 2, 3,
    and 4 are the parameters. The instruction 99 contains only an opcode and
    has no parameters.

    The address of the current instruction is called the instruction pointer;
    it starts at 0. After an instruction finishes, the instruction pointer
    increases by the number of values in the instruction; until you add more
    instructions to the computer, this is always 4 (1 opcode + 3 parameters)
    for the add and multiply instructions. (The halt instruction would increase
    the instruction pointer by 1, but it halts the program instead.)

    "With terminology out of the way, we're ready to proceed. To complete the
    gravity assist, you need to determine what pair of inputs produces the
    output 19690720."

    The inputs should still be provided to the program by replacing the values
    at addresses 1 and 2, just like before. In this program, the value placed
    in address 1 is called the noun, and the value placed in address 2 is
    called the verb. Each of the two input values will be between 0 and 99,
    inclusive.

    Once the program has halted, its output is available at address 0, also
    just like before. Each time you try a pair of inputs, make sure you first
    reset the computer's memory to the values in the program (your puzzle
    input) - in other words, don't reuse memory from a previous attempt.

    Find the input noun and verb that cause the program to produce the output
    19690720. What is 100 * noun + verb? (For example, if noun=12 and verb=2,
    the answer would be 1202.)
